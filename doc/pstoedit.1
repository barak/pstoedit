FROM GSVIEW
.PP
From within gsview pstoedit can be called via 
"
.BR "Edit | Convert to vector format""
.PP
.SS
FROM PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE ALDUS GRAPHIC IMPORT FILTER INTERFACE
.PP
pstoedit
can also be used as PostScript and PDF graphic import filter for several programs including 
MS\-Office 95/97, PaintShop\-Pro and PhotoLine. See 
.BR "http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Network/1958/importps/"
for more

DESCRIPTION
.PP
.SS
RELEASE LEVEL
.PP
This manpage documents release 3.1x of pstoedit.
.PP
.SS
USE
.PP
pstoedit
converts PostScript and PDF files to various vector graphic 
formats. The resulting files can be edited or imported into various drawing 
packages. Type 
.PP
.BR "pstoedit \-help"
.PP
to get a list of supported output formats. Pstoedit comes with a 
large set of format drivers integrated in the binary. Additional drivers can be 
installed as plugins and are available via 
.BR "http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Network/1958/plugins/".
Just 
copy the plugins to the same directory where the pstoedit binary is installed. 
However, unless you also get a license key for the plugins, the additional 
drivers will slightly distort the resulting graphics. See the documentation 
provided with the plugins for further details. 
.PP
.SS
PRINCIPLE OF CONVERSION
.PP
pstoedit
works by redefining the two basic painting operators of 
PostScript, 
.BR "stroke"
and 
.BR "show"
(bitmaps drawn by the image 
operator are currently only supported by the xfig and the MIF backend.) After 
redefining these operators, the PostScript or PDF file that needs to be 
converted is processed by a PostScript interpreter, e.g., Ghostscript 
(
.I "gs"
(1)).
You normally need to have a PostScript interpreter installed in 
order to use this program. However, you can perform some "back end" processing 
of prepared files by specifying the 
.BR "\-bo"
option for debugging or limited 
filtering. See "BACK END\-SPECIFIC OPTIONS" below. 
.PP
The output that is written by the interpreter due to the redefinition of the 
drawing operators is a sort of 'flat' PostScript file that contains only simple 
operations like moveto, lineto, show, etc. You can look at this file using the 
.BR "\-f debug"
option. 
.PP
This output is read by end\-processing functions of pstoedit
and triggers 
the drawing functions in the selected back end driver, or backend. 
.PP
.SS
NOTES
.PP
If you want to process PDF files directly, your PostScript interpreter must 
provide this feature, as does Ghostscript. Aladdin Ghostscript 4.03 or later is 
recommended for processing PDF (and PostScript Level 2) files. 
.PP
.SH
OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-dt"
Text is drawn as polygons. This might produce a large output file. This option is automatically 
switched on if the selected backend does not support this, e.g. 
.I "gnuplot"
(1).
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-dis"
Open a display during processing by Ghostscript. Some files 
only work correctly this way. 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-psarg" " string"
The string given with this option is passed 
directly to Ghostscript when Ghostscript is called to process the 
PostScript file for pstoedit.
For example: 
.BR "\-psarg"
.BR " ""
.BR "\-r300x300"
.BR """
This causes the resolution to be changed to 
300x300 dpi. (With older versions of GhostScript, changing the resolution 
this way has an effect only if 
.BR "\-display"
is set.) 
.PP
You can switch Ghostscript into PostScript Level 1 only mode by 
.BR "\-psarg "level1.ps"".
This can be useful for example if the PostScript file to be 
converted uses some Level 2 specific custom color models that are not supported 
by pstoedit. However, this requires that the PostScript program checks for the 
PostScript level supported by the interpreter and "acts" accordingly. 
.PP
If you want to pass multiple options to Ghostscript you must can use multiple 
\-psarg options 
.BR "\-psarg opt1"
.BR "\-psarg opt2"
.BR "\-psarg opt2".
See the GhostScript manual for other possible options. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-merge"
Some output formats permit the representation of filled 
polygons with edges that are in a different color than the fill color. 
Since PostScript does not support this, drawing programs typically 
generate two objects (the outline and the filled polygon) into the 
PostScript output. pstoedit
is able to recombine these, if they 
follow each other directly and you specify 
.BR "\-merge".
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-page" " page number"
Select a single page from a multi page 
PostScript or PDF file. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-split"
Create a new file for each page of the input. For this the 
output filename must contain a %d which is replaced with the current page 
number. This option is automatically switched on for backends that don't 
support multiple pages within one file, e.g. fig or gnuplot. 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-df" " fontname"
Sometimes fonts embedded in a PostScript 
programs do not have a fontname. For example, this happens in PostScript 
files generated by 
.I "dvips"
(1).
In such a case pstoedit
uses a 
replacement font. The default for this is Courier. Another font can be 
specified using the 
.BR "\-df"
option. 
.BR "\-df Helvetica"
causes all 
unnamed fonts to be replaced by Helvetica. 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-include" " name of a PostScript file to be included"
This 
options allows to specify an additional PostScript file that will be 
executed just before the normal input is read. This is helpful for 
including specific page settings or for disabling potentially unsafe 
PostScript operators, e.g., file, renamefile, or deletefile. 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-fontmap" " name of font map file for pstoedit"
The font map is a 
simple text file containing lines in the following format: 
.PP
document_font_name target_font_name 
.br
% lines beginning with  % are comments 
.br
% if a font name contains spaces, use 
.br
% the "font name with spaces" notation. 
.PP
Each font name found in the document is checked agains this mapping and if 
there is a corresponding entry, the new name is used for the output. 
.PP
If the 
.BR "\-fontmap"
option is not specified, pstoedit
automatically looks for the file 
.IR "drivername".fmp
in the installation 
directory and uses that file as a default fontmap file if available. The 
installation directory is: 
.PP
.RS
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP
.B *
Windows: The same directory where the pstoedit
executable is 
located 
.RS

.PP
.RE
.RE
.PP
The mpost.fmp in the misc directory of the pstoedit distibution is a sample 
map file with mappings from over 5000 PostScript font names to their TeX
equivalents. This is useful because MetaPost is frequently used with 
TeX/LaTeX and those programs don't use standard font names. This file and 
the MetaPost backend are provided by Scott Pakin 
(
.BR "pakin@cs.uiuc.edu").
.PP
Another example is wemf.fmp to be used under Windows. See the misc 
directory of the pstoedit distribution. 
.PP
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-f" " format"
target output format recognized by 
pstoedit.
Since other format drivers can be loaded dynamically, 
type pstoedit \-help
to get a full list of formats. See "BACK 
END\-SPECIFIC OPTIONS" below for an explanation of the [
.I ":options"
]
to 
.BR "\-f"
format. 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-scale" " factor"
scale by the specified factor. (Currently used with 
.BR "\-f tgif"
backend only.) 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-ssp"
simulate sub paths 
.br
Several backend don't support PostScript pathes containing sub pathes, i.e. 
pathes with intermediate movetos. In the normal case, each subpath is 
treated as an independent path for such backends. This can lead to bad 
looking results. The most common case where this happens is if you use the 
.BR "\-dt"
option and show some text with letters like e, o, or b, i.e. 
letter that have a "hole". When the 
.BR "\-ssp"
option is set, pstoedit 
tries to eliminate these problems. However, this option is CPU time 
intensive! 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-sclip"
simulate clipping 
.br
Most backends of pstoedit don't have native support for clipping. For that 
pstoedit
offers an option to perform the clipping of the graphics 
directly without passing the clippath to the backends. However, this 
results in curves being replaces by a lot of line segments and thus larger 
output files. So use this option only if your output looks different from 
the input due to clipping. In addition, this "simulated clipping" is not 
exactly the same as defined in PostScript. There might be lines drawn at 
the double size. Also clipping of text is not supported unless you also use 
the 
.BR "\-dt"
option. 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-pagesize" "string"
set page size for output medium 
.br
This option sets the page size for the output medium. Currently this 
is just used by the libplot backend, but might be used by other 
backends in future. The page size is specified in terms of the usual 
page size names, e.g. letter or a4. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-bo"
You can run backend processing only (without the PostScript 
interpreter frontend) by first running 
.BR "pstoedit"
.BR "\-f dump"
.IR "infile"
.IR "dumpfile"
and then running 
.BR "pstoedit"
.BI "\-f" " format"
.BR "\-bo"
.IR "dumpfile"
.IR "outfile".
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-flat" " number"
If the backend does not support curves in the way 
PostScript does or if the 
.BR "\-nc"
option is specified, all curves are 
approximated by lines. Using the 
.BR "\-flat"
option one can control this 
approximation. This parameter is directly converted to a PostScript 
.BR "setflat"
command. Higher numbers, e.g. 10 give rougher, lower 
numbers, e.g. 0.1 finer approximations. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-nb"
Since version 3.10 pstoedit
uses the 
\-dDELAYBIND
option when calling GhostScript. Previously the 
\-dNOBIND
option was used instead but that sometimes caused 
problems if a user's PostScript file overloaded standard PostScript 
operator with totally new semantic, e.g. lt for lineto. Using 
.BR "\-nb"
the 
old style can be activated again in case the \-dDELAYBIND
gives 
different results as before. In such a case please also contact the 
author. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-nc"
no curves 
.br
Normally pstoedit tries to keep curves from the input and transfers them to 
the output if the output format supports curves. If the backend does not 
support curves, then pstoedit replaces curves by a series of lines (see 
also 
.BR "\-flat"
option). However, in some cases the user might wish to 
have this behavior also for backends that originally support curves. This 
can be forced via the 
.BR "\-nc"
option. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-nq"
No exit from the PostScript interpreter. Normally Ghostscript 
exits after processing the pstoedit inputfile. For debugging it can be 
useful to avoid this. If you do, you will have to type quit at the 
GS> prompt to exit from Ghostscript. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-v"
Switch on verbose mode. Some additional information is shown 
during processing. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-nomaptoisolatin1"
Normally pstoedit
maps all character 
codes to the ones defined by the ISO\-Latin1 encoding. If you specify 
.BR "\-nomaptoisolatin1"
then the encoding from the input PostScript is 
passed unchanged to the output. 
.PP
.TP
.IR "inputfile"
input file. 
.PP
.TP
.IR "outputfile"
output file. If no output file is given as argument, 
pstoedit
writes the result to standard output. 
.PP
If neither an input nor an output file is given as argument, pstoedit works as filter reading from standard input and 
writing to standard output. 
.PP
.SH
BACK END\-SPECIFIC OPTIONS
.PP
pstoedit
allows you to pass individual options to a backend. This is done by 
appending all options to the format specified after the 
.BR "\-f"
option. The format 
specifier and its options must be separated by a colon (:). If more than one 
option needs to be passed to the backend, the whole argument to 
.BR "\-f"
must be 
enclosed within double\-quote characters, thus: 
.PP
.BR "\-f"
.BR " ""
.BR "format:option option ..."
.BR """
.PP
Currently 
.IR "met",
.IR "java",
.IR "dxf",
.IR "pic",
.IR "fig",
.IR "metapost"
and 
.IR "wmf"
are the only drivers accepting specific options. 
Other options may be asserted through environment variables. See "ENVIRONMENT 
VARIABLES" below. 
.PP
The 
.IR "wmf"
driver supports two backend specific options, '
.BR "v"'
and 
'
.BR "e"'.
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-f wmf:v"
turns on a verbose mode; 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-f wmf:e"
tells pstoedit
to generate an enhanced metafile 
instead of a normal metafile. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-f wmf:ve"
specifies both verbose mode and enhanced metafile 
output. 
.PP
The 
.IR "java"
backend allows to specify the class name of the class that is 
generated by pstoedit. The default is PSJava. You can change this using 
.PP
.TP
.BI "\-f java:" "anothername"
.PP
The 
.IR "dxf"
backend accepts the option 
.BR "\-lines"
which forces all 
polygons and lines to be represented as LINEs in the generated DXF file. The 
default is to use POLYLINEs. 
.PP
Example: 
.BR "\-f"
.BR " ""
.BR "dxf:\-lines"
.BR """
.PP
The 
.IR "met"
backend allows the following single character options (without a 
leading \-) 
.PP
.TP
.BR "w"
Draw into an opened window instead of a metafile. 
.TP
.BR "p"
Draw no geometric linewidths, all lines have a width of zero. 
.TP
.BR "l"
No filling of polygon interiors. 
.TP
.BR "c"
No colors, just greyscales. 
.TP
.BR "t"
Omit all text. 
.TP
.BR "g"
Omit all graphics. 
.TP
.BR "v"
Put verbose output to drvMET.out.
.PP
Example: 
.BR "\-f"
.BR " ""
.BR "met:wlc"
.BR """
.PP
The 
.IR "pic"
backend accepts the options: 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-troff"
.TP
.BR "\-groff"
which forces output to be compatible with troff and groff, 
respectively. Groff mode is default, troff mode severely limiting 
the choice of supported text fonts. 
.PP
BUG: these options really does not belong in a backend 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-keep"
makes the pic backend emit the full font name of fonts that does 
not map to built\-in groff fonts. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-text"
makes the pic backend attempt to recognize running text, and 
treat it accordingly. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-landscape"
.TP
.BR "\-portrait"
to compensate for the postscript orientation. Portrait mode is 
default. 
.PP
Example: 
.BR "\-f"
.BR " ""
.BR "pic:\-troff \-text \-landscape"
.BR """
.PP
The 
.IR "fig"
driver accepts the following options: 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-f31"
tells the driver to output the version 31 format instead 
of the default version 32 format. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-depth"
depth in inches. Sets the paper width to the specified size in inches. 
.PP
The 
.IR "ps2ai"
driver provides an option to select to old AI\-88 format 
instead of the default AI\-3 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-88"
selects the AI\-88 format. 
.PP
Example: 
.BR "\-f ps2ai:\-88"
.PP
The 
.IR "tgif"
driver provides option to control the conversion of text 
strings into hyperlink attributes. 
.PP
.TP
.BR "\-ta"
enables the conversion of text into boxes with hyperlink attributes. More 
options allowing finer control about this new feature will follow in 
future versions. 
.PP
The GNU libplot driver (
.IR "gmfa",
.IR "gmfb",
.IR "plot")
provides a huge 
set of options. All these are described in the header of the drvlplot.cpp file. 
.PP
.SS
NOTES
.PP
.TP
Ps2ai:
.PP
The ps2ai backend is not a native pstoedit backend. It does not use the 
pstoedit postcript flattener, instead it uses the PostScript program 
ps2ai.ps which is installed in the GhostScript distribution directory. It 
is included to provide the same "look\-and\-feel" for the conversion to AI. 
The additional benefit is that this conversion is now available also via 
the "convert\-to\-vector" menu of Gsview. However, lot's of files don't 
convert nicely or at all using ps2ai.ps. So a native pstoedit driver would 
be much better. Anyone out there to take this ? The AI format is usable for 
example by Mayura Draw (
.BR "http://www.mayura.com").
Also a driver to the 
Mayura native format would be nice. In order to make this driver work 
correctly, you have to apply the following simple patch to the 
ps2ai.ps
file (I hope this will go into future releases of 
GhostScript): 
.PP
After the line "/vers {2.13} def" insert: 
.PP
/cdef { 1 index where { pop pop pop } { def } ifelse } def 
.PP
Replace the lines: 
.PP
"/jout false def" 
.PP
with 
.PP
"/jout false cdef" 
.PP
(notice the cdef instead of def) 
.PP
"/joutput (ps2ai.out.aips) def" 
.PP
with 
.PP
"/joutput (ps2ai.out.aips) cdef" 
.PP
"/joutln false def" 
.PP
with 
.PP
"/joutln false cdef" 
.PP
and the line 
.PP
"/jtxt3 true def" 
.PP
with 
.PP
"/jtxt3 true cdef" 
.PP
Note: If you already patched 
.IR "ps2ai"
for pstoedit version 3.02. you 
have to change to the patch above. This version is different but it better 
fits the ideas of Peter L. Deutsch. Sorry for the confusion, but this way 
chances are better that this version will go into the GhostScript 
distribution. 
.PP
.TP
MetaPost:
.PP
Note that, as far as Scott knows, MetaPost does not support PostScript's 
eofill. My backend just converts eofill to fill, and issues a warning if 
verbose is set. Fortunately, very few PostScript programs rely on the 
even\-odd fill rule, even though many specify it. 
.PP
For more on MetaPost see: 
.PP
.BR "http://cm.bell\-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html"
.PP
.TP
creating a new backend:
.PP
To implement a new backend you can start from drvsampl.cpp
and 
drvsampl.h.
See also comments in drvbase.h
and 
drvfuncs.h
for an explanation of methods that should be implemented 
for a new backend. 
.PP
.SS
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.PP
A default PostScript interpreter to be called by pstoedit is specified at 
compile time. You can overwrite the default by setting the GS environment 
variable to the name of a suitable PostScript interpreter. 
.PP
You can check which name of a PostScript interpreter was compiled into 
pstoedit using: 
.BR "pstoedit"
.BR "\-help \-v".
.PP
See the GhostScript manual for descriptions of environment variables used by 
Ghostscript most importantly GS_FONTPATH and GS_LIB; other 
environment variables also affect output to display, print, and additional 
filtering and processing. See the related documentation. 
.PP
pstoedit
allocates temporary files using the function 
.I "tempnam"
(3).
Thus the location for temporary files might be controllable by other 
environment variables used by this function. See the 
.I "tempnam"
(3)
manpage 
for descriptions of environment variables used. On UNIX like system this is 
probably the TMPDIR variable, on DOS/WINDOWS either TMP or 
TEMP. 
.PP
.SS
SYSTEM SPECIFIC NOTES
.PP
.TP
DOS/WINDOWS
.PP
pstoedit compiled with MS\-Visual C++ or Borland C++ runs under 32\-bit 
only. It might run under WIN32s, but certainly does not run under plain 
16\-bit DOS. 
.PP
pstoedit
works best if you installed at least version 5.50 of 
GhostScript and version 2.71 of gsview. Using older version of 
GhostScript is possible but requires the setting of some environment 
variables. 
.PP
.TP
OS/2
.PP
When running pstoedit
on OS/2 you need to call it using the 
script ps2edit.cmd.
.PP
.SS
TROUBLE SHOOTING
.PP
If you have problems with pstoedit
first try whether Ghostscript 
successfully displays your file. If yes try 
.BR "pstoedit"
.BR "\-f ps"
.IR "infile.ps"
.IR "testfile.ps"
and check whether 
.IR "testfile.ps"
still displays correctly using 
Ghostscript. If this file doesn't look correctly then there seems to be a 
problem with pstoedit's
PostScript frontend. If this file looks good 
but the output for a specific format is wrong, the problem is probably in 
the backend for the specific format. In either case send bug fixes and 
reports to the author. 
.PP
A common problem with PostScript files is that the PostScript file redefines 
one of the standard PostScript operators inconsistently. There is no effect 
of this if you just print the file since the original PostScript "program" 
uses these new operator in the new meaning and does not use the original 
ones anymoew. However, when run under the control of pstoedit, these 
operators are expected to work with the original semantics. 
.PP
So far I've seen redefinitions for: 
.PP
.TP
.B *
lt \- "less\-then" to mean "draw a line to" 
.TP
.B *
string \- "create a string object" to mean "draw a string" 
.TP
.B *
length \- "get the length of e.g. a string" to a "float constant" 
.PP
I've included work\-arounds for the ones mentioned above, but some others 
could show up in addition to those. 
.PP
.SS
RESTRICTIONS
.PP
Non\-standard fonts (e.g. TeXbitmap fonts) are mapped to a default font which 
can be changed using the 
.BR "\-df"
option. pstoedit
chooses the size of 
the replacement font such that the width of the string in the original font is 
the same as in the replacement font. This is done for each text fragment 
displayed. Special character encoding support is limited in this case. If a 
character cannot be mapped into the target format, pstoedit displays a '#' 
instead. 
.PP
pstoedit supports bitmap graphics only for the xfig and MIF backends. 
.PP
The Gnuplot backend and the 3D backends (rpl, lwo, rib) do not support text. 
.PP
The OS/2 met backend sometimes causes the viewer to fail, although drawing 
directly to screen works. This problem is solved with OS/2 FixPak 22. 
.PP
Generally, pstoedit does not support clipping. 
.PP
Special note about the Java backend 
.PP
The java backend generates a java source file that needs other files in 
order to be compiled and usable. These other files are Java classes (one 
applet and support classes) that allow to step through the individual pages 
of a converted PostScript document. This applet can easily be activated from 
a html\-document. See the java/readme_java.txt
file for more details. 
.PP
.SS
FAQS
.PP
Why do letters like O or B get strange if converted to tgif/xfig 
using the 
.BR "\-dt"
option? 
.PP
This is because most backends don't support composite paths with 
intermediate gaps (moveto's) and second don't support very well the (eo)fill 
operators of PostScript (winding rule). For such objects pstoedit
breaks 
them into smaller objects whenever such a gap is found. This results in the 
"hole" beeing filled with black color instead of beeing transparent. Since 
version 3.11 you can try the 
.BR "\-ssp"
option in combination with the xfig 
backend.
