Unfortunately, there is a small incompatibility between pstoedit 2.60 and
GhostScript 5.x which causes every translation to fail. However, the
fix is very easy:
just replace deviceinfo with currentpagedevice in pstoedit.ph and
compile again. 

Actually this bug in pstoedit is caused by a bug fix in GhostScript.
pstoedit used the deviceinfo operator but its presence in earlier
releases was a bug in GhostScript. 
Thanks for L. Peter Deutsch - the author of GhostScript - for pointing out the 
simple fix.
