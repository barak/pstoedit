 I explicitly wrote "please send ..." and not "you have to". So
 your last interpretation is what I had in mind. So feel free

 intellectual property claims:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
 Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,

 .
 3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS
 .
 3.1 Application of License. The Source Code version of Original Code may be
 distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
 License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
 with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose
 any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable
 version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license for
 shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance
 with this Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with all
 requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120)
 days before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
 Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish either (i)
 any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation of Your
 Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your
 Modifications in Source Code form, and to make any such deviation and reference
 implementation or Modifications available to all third parties under the same
 terms as this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your
 first customer shipment of Your Modifications.
 .
 3.2 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file
 of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
 Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
 location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look
 for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your
 name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
 duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
 describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Initial Code. You
 may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
 liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code.
 However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
 Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
 support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
 hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by
 the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
 terms You offer.
 .
 3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Original Code in
 Executable and Source form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2
 have been met for that Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that
 the Source Code version of the Original Code is available under the terms of
 this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
 Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You
 describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute
 the Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership
 rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
 this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
 License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under a different
 license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
 License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby
 agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the
 Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
 3.4 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with
 other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
 of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.
 .
 4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
 with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial
 order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License
 to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code
 they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
 Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
 Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must
 be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 .
 5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the
 notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set out in Section 3.1.
 .
 6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
 .

 from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

 particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
 terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the
 terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other
 than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.
 .
 7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
 .
 ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,
 FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

 WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL
 CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8.0 TERMINATION
 .
 8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically

 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Original Code
 which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.
 Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination
 of this License shall survive.
 .
 8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user license
 agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly
 granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
 termination.
 .
 9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
 NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
 OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
 OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
 OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION,
 OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
 HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING
 FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
 LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
 INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
 APPLY TO YOU.
