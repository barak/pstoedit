<h1 align="left">Changelog for pstoedit</h1>

<h2>New or changed in 3.31:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>prepared the EMF/WMF drivers to compile against the
        libEMF (<a href="mailto:libemf@lignumcomputing.com">libemf@lignumcomputing.com</a>)
        which allows to create WMF/EMF files under *nix. But -
        the libEMF is not yet released. Stay tuned. </li>
    <li>include some patches for the OS/2 port and bug fixes for
        drvmma and drvmet submitted by Thomas Hoffman (<a
        href="mailto:thoffman@zappa.sax.de">thoffman@zappa.sax.de</a>).</li>
    <li>automatic conversion of curves to lines also in case the
        -bo (backend only) option is used and the target format/driver
        doesn't support curves.</li>
    <li>Donald Arseneau (asnd@triumf.ca) adds pen changes when
        color changes to the HPGL backend. To be activated using
        the -pencolors option.</li>
    <li>several portability fixed, e.g. now pstoedit compiles
        with g++3.0.</li>
    <li>changed the place where pstoedit's data file (font map
        tables, ...) are stored ($prefix/share/pstoedit under *nix).</li>
    <li>added support to produce the shared library libpstoedit.so
        under Linux - Thanks to Russell Lang.</li>
    <li>added a general -help option for each driver to show
        driver specific options. For example -f xfig:-help shows
        specific options for the fig backend.</li>
    <li>minor bug fix in CGM backend - some pathes triggered an
        assertion violation.</li>
    <li>several enhancements for the DXF backend. Now it supports
        the DXF SPLINE element as well. Big thanks to Daniel
        Gehriger <a href="mailto:gehriger@linkcad.com">(gehriger@linkcad.com</a>)
        for his help concerning the DXF format. </li>
    <li>support for TeX fonts in the SVG backend. Big thanks to
        Michel Goossens for the suggestions and his help. He can
        also provide the SVG definitions of the CM TeX fonts. See
        also <a href="http://home.cern.ch/goossens/svgfonts.html">http://home.cern.ch/goossens/svgfonts.html</a>
        .</li>
    <li>Now the SVG driver also supports a font map.</li>
    <li>some minor bug fixes in the PostScript frontend related
        to font handling.</li>
    <li>changed &quot;Killustrator&quot; to &quot;Kontour&quot;
        where appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.30:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>new backend for Mathematica - contributed by Manfred
        Thole &lt;manfred@thole.org&gt;</li>
    <li>new SWF backend (beta release state - still lot's of
        features missing (fonts, dash handling, ...). This
        backend is based on the ming API (<a
        href="http://www.opaque.net/ming/">www.opaque.net/ming/</a>).</li>
    <li>cleanup of the xfig backend. In some cases X-splines
        looked very different from the original image. Now the X-splines
        that are produced by the xfig backend are constrained
        differently, so that they fit the bezier curve better.
        Thanks to Ian MacPhedran.</li>
    <li>added an option -startdepth to the xfig driver</li>
    <li>improved support for various types of PostScript image
        operators. Now there is an option for backend developers
        to ask for a PNG file to be generated directly by the
        frontend (at GhostScript level). Currently this is used
        only for the SVG backend, but more will follow later.</li>
    <li>added an option -adt (automatic draw text). This
        selectively enables -dt for all fonts that don't look
        like a text font. </li>
    <li>Now the BoundingBox is provided to the backends - though
        not all make use of it so far.</li>
    <li>man improvements to the SVG backend (plugin) like support
        for dashes, clipping, raster images, Symbol font</li>
    <li>fixed a bug which showed up with PostScript files
        generated by the new Adobe PostScript driver.</li>
    <li>some extensions (new options) to the TK backend -
        contributed by Chris Cox</li>
    <li>added support for writing the output to a file it the
        input is stdin (pstoedit -f format - outfile). This
        allows to implement a pstoedit printer driver via redmon.
        You can print directly to any format pstoedit supports
        directly from any Windows application.</li>
    <li>-rgb (instead of now default CMYK)</li>
    <li>now pages can be rotated arbitrarily (-rotate). Thanks to
        Andrew Birrell &lt;birrell@pa.dec.com&gt; for the
        permission to use the corresponding code from pstotext).</li>
    <li>made the source code almost clean concerning FlexeLint
        messages (By the way, I like this tool- see <a
        href="http://www.gimpel.com">www.gimpel.com</a> )</li>
    <li>addes some assertions in to the code to further runtime
        checking</li>
    <li>added a %TGIF header to support the Unix file command. (Thanks
        to <a href="mailto:Gintautas.Grigelionis@ki.ericsson.se">Gintautas.Grigelionis@ki.ericsson.se</a>)</li>
    <li>fixed a compilation problem with SUN's C++ compilers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.21:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>some extensions (new options) to the TK backend. Now
        supports multiple pages as well - Thanks to Chris Cox.
        See manual for more details.</li>
    <li>bugfix : -pagesize option was not recognized correctly.</li>
    <li>minor bugfix in FIG backend to be compliant with prtfig.</li>
    <li>bugfix in the frontend (lexer). Now the lexer can be
        started multiple times after each other. This is
        important for programs using the pstoedit.dll.</li>
    <li>added support for writing PNG in image.cpp. Now backends
        can use this to write raster images into PNG files.</li>
    <li>improved plugins: CGM (supports Bezier now), SVG (supports
        raster images) and EMF (supports raster images), importps
        (supports raster images).</li>
    <li>reanimation of the OS/2 port - thanks to Thomas Hoffmann.</li>
    <li>the binary releases are now linked with the libplotter (GNU
        plotutils <a
        href="http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/plotutils.html</a>
        ) to allow direct access to the variety of drivers
        contained in that library (FIG, PCL, HPGL, TEK, X11 (Unix
        only), SVG, CGM, AI). Some formats are now available in
        two versions. One directly with a native driver in
        pstoedit and one via the libplot.</li>
    <li>pstoedit now cooperates with autotrace. Autotrace can now
        produce a dump file for further processing by pstoedit
        using the -bo (backend only) option. Autotrace is a
        program written by a group around Martin Weber and can be
        found at&nbsp; <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.20:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>fixed a bug with precision text (-pti/a).</li>
    <li>fixed a bug in pstoedit.ph.</li>
    <li>new backend latex2e contributed by <a
        href="mailto:pakin@cs.uiuc.edu">Scott Pakin</a>.</li>
    <li>include SVG driver into binary releases for Linux/Solaris.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.19:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>experimental support for filling in the HPGL backend.</li>
    <li>implement copypage same as showpage plus emit a warning.</li>
    <li>fixed a bug in consistency checking (frontend vs. backend
        when using the -bo option)</li>
    <li>automatic enabling of -dt option if backend doesn't
        support text.</li>
    <li>fixed a bug in memory allocation. Windows requires that
        the memory is deallocated in the same DLL as it was
        allocated. This was a problem with some plugins.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.18:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>new java2 backend which supports much better rendering
        than the old java1 backend. Thanks to <a
        href="mailto:gisbert@tapirsoft.de">Gisbert W. Selke</a>
        of <a href="http://www.tapirsoft.de">TapirSoft Gisbert
        &amp; Harald Selke GbR</a>.</li>
    <li>new option (-t2fontast1) to handle type 2 fonts similarly
        to t1 fonts - This is sort of experimental.</li>
    <li>fixed one bug in the binary cgm (too long header).</li>
    <li>fixed a bug in the configure script.</li>
    <li>made the postscript output again more DSC compliant as
        pointed out by Russell Lang</li>
    <li>made the code more &quot;cleaner&quot; concerning rules
        checked by CodeWizard (<a href="http://www.parasoft.com">www.parasoft.com</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.17:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>included a patch for idraw to support bitmap images.
        Thanks to Scott Johnston for the contribution.</li>
    <li>much improved WMF backend by Thorsten Behrens.</li>
    <li>experimental support for SVG (<a
        href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG</a>/)
        in the <a href="http://www.pstoedit.net/plugins/">plugins.dll</a>.</li>
    <li>added a function to the DLL interface for gsview to clean
        up memory allocated by the pstoedit.dll.</li>
    <li>added an option (-uchar) which allows to define the
        character to be used instead of characters that are not
        available in the standard character encoding but
        nevertheless used by the input PostScript/PDF file.</li>
    <li>allow standard output to be used also for backends that
        don't support multiple pages as suggested by Andread
        Amann</li>
    <li>added a BeginSetup / EndSetup to the PostScript output to
        allow reading in CorelDraw 3/4 as proposed by Martin
        Weber</li>
    <li>added a consistency check if the -bo option is used to
        avoid problems when the selected backend has some
        restrictions, e.g. does not support curves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.16:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>fixed some small memory leaks (missing [] with delete)
        and a potential null pointer access. Thanks to <a
        href="www.parasoft.com">Parasoft</a> for a temporary
        license for Linux of their Insure++. It was quite easy to
        find these bugs with this tool.</li>
    <li>changed the starting depth of objects in xfig format from
        999 to 499. This allows new objects to be inserted in
        front or behind the converted figure.</li>
    <li>the makefile for pstoedit can now be configured
        automatically using configure - at least on Un*x like
        systems. Thanks <a href="mailto:pakin@cs.uiuc.edu">Scott
        Pakin</a> for providing the necessary packages.</li>
    <li>added the -pti and -pta option which allows for &quot;precision
        text&quot; via individual placement of each character
        within a string.</li>
    <li>the tgif backend now supports arbitray streched text. The
        text placement is currently not fully correct. This
        problem will probably be fixed in tgif 4.1.26. </li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.15:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>fixed a compilation problem and makefile problem (make
        install).</li>
    <li>switch to a new documentation style. The manual page is
        now originally written in LaTeX and translated to Un*x
        man format and HTML. Thanks to Rolf Niepraschk (<a
        href="mailto:niepraschk@ptb.de">niepraschk@ptb.de</a>)&nbsp;
        for this work. The Linux community will have big thanks
        for this contribution.</li>
    <li>added a new option to set the page size for the output
        medium. However this is currently used by the libplot
        backend only.</li>
    <li>some small correction on the libplot driver.</li>
    <li>fixed the broken -scale option for the tgif backend.</li>
    <li>backends can now access the current setting of the
        miterlimit using currentMiterLimit().</li>
    <li>text consisting entirely of spaces is now suppressed.
        This caused problems with some backends, e.g. xfig.</li>
    <li>changed the version of drvbase (because of the miterlimit
        and pagesize support). This means that all plugins need
        to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you
        will get an error message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.14:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>added two checkboxes for the importps dialog</li>
    <li>bug fix related to font caching in the EMF backend</li>
    <li>added a bugfix for the MetaPost backend received from
        Scott Pakin</li>
    <li>incorporated a lot of improvements to the libplot driver.
        Thanks to Robert S. Maier (<a
        href="mailto:rsm@math.arizona.edu">rsm@math.arizona.edu</a>)<br>
        Notice: most of these improvement will need at least
        libplot version 2.3. See drvlplot.cpp for all the new
        options.</li>
    <li>pstoedit now implicitly looks for a driver specific
        fontmap file named &lt;drivername&gt;.fmp </li>
    <li>fixed a problem (bug in gs??) which was caused by some
        PDF files when gs5.50 was used. This problem did not
        occur anymore with newer versions of gs.</li>
    <li>added the classed needed by the generated Java Code to
        the distribution (see java subdirectory)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.13:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>change in frontend and drvbase: Now the full effective
        font matrix can be retrieved by backends</li>
    <li>changed again the version of drvbase (because of the font
        matrix functions). This means that all plugins need to be
        updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will
        get an error message.</li>
    <li>added a new backend for the sketch format ( <a
        href="http://www.online.de/home/sketch/">http://www.online.de/home/sketch/</a>
        ) contributed by <br>
        Bernhard Herzog (<a href="mailto:herzog@online.de">herzog@online.de</a>)</li>
    <li>many improvements in the MetaPost backend and a better
        fontmap.mpost by Scott Pakin.</li>
    <li>minor bug fix with line width and text elements in the
        TGIF backend.</li>
    <li>added an option to the TGIF backend to generate HREF
        attributes for each text element (proposed by Tobias
        Buchal <a href="mailto:buchal41@che41a0.der.edf.fr">buchal41@che41a0.der.edf.fr</a>).
        This is still in an experimenal stage!</li>
    <li>added an option (-nc) to force the replacement of curves
        with line segments even for backends that support curves.</li>
    <li>fixed a bug with the -flat option not beeing honoured
        correctly in combination with the new -nc option</li>
    <li>added an option to emulate clipping (-sclip). This
        however results in larger number of points ! Use it only
        if the missing support for clipping causes problems with
        your file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.12:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>small bug fix in the meta post backend (blank font names)
        and in the fontmap.mpost file.</li>
    <li>several bug fixes and code reorganization in the subpath
        simulation part.</li>
    <li>sub path simulation is now available for all backends,
        not just xfig. However, this was not tested very
        intensively so far. It works quite well with xfig and
        tgif.</li>
    <li>bug fix for related to the usage of &quot;-f gs:...&quot;.</li>
    <li>small bug fix in the metapost driver and some additions
        to the fontmap.mpost file.</li>
    <li>added a setglobal also for the &quot;non -nb&quot; case
        to pstoedit.pro to cope with gs5.82.</li>
    <li>bux fix in documentation (-fontmap instead of -mapfile).</li>
    <li>added some support for easier retrieval of dash patterns
        from within backends.</li>
    <li>extended the check for &quot;mergable&quot; path to
        include also eofilled pathes and made pathsCanBeMerged
        virtual so it can be overloaded by a specific backend.</li>
    <li>changed again the version of drvbase. This means that all
        plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys).
        Otherwise you will get an error message.</li>
    <li>bug fix in the EMF driver of the plugins.dll and importps.dll
        regarding the handling of closepath.</li>
    <li>added an option to the xfig backend to set the paper
        width (-f &quot;xfig:-depth <em>depth in inches</em>&quot;)</li>
    <li>added an option to the ps2ai driver (-88) to activate the
        AI-88 format instead of the AI-3 format</li>
    <li>added a fontmap.win in the misc directory as an example
        for a Windows fontmap file. (-fontmap option)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.11:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>improved handling of TrueType fonts under Windows 9x/NT.
        Pstoedit can now deal with TrueType fonts if GhostScript
        is configured for TrueType support.</li>
    <li>fixed an incompatibility with older version of
        GhostScript</li>
    <li>fixed a bug that was caused when the GS_LIB variable was
        set.</li>
    <li>added a new backend for the libplot (GNU plotutils)
        library () (GNU MetaFiles). This allows to use the
        additional format drivers of the GNU plotting utilities.</li>
    <li>Burkhard Plaum <a
        href="mailto:(plaum@IPF.Uni-Stuttgart.de">(plaum@IPF.Uni-Stuttgart.de</a>)
        added support for complex filled paths (paths consisting
        of an arbitraty sequence of moveto, lineto and curveto in
        combination with fill and eofill) to the xfig backend. In
        future, this will be made available to other backend that
        don't support such pathes as well. In order to activate
        this feature you need to specify the -ssp (simulate sub
        paths) option.</li>
    <li>changed again the version of drvbase due to the support
        for complex paths. This means that all plugins need to be
        updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will
        get an error message.</li>
    <li>improved the EMF driver in the importps.dll. I now
        generates much more compact EMF files.</li>
    <li>Added a general option for specifying a file containing a
        font mapping (document font -&gt; font in target format).
        So far this was just used in the mpost backend but this
        is now available for general usage. See the misc
        directory in the source distribution for an example.</li>
    <li>removed the STL dependency in the mport driver. This
        driver can now be compiled as well without having the STL.</li>
    <li>some internal code reorganization.</li>
    <li>fixed a bug in the test target of the makefile</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.10:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>replaced the -dNOBIND with -dDELAYBIND (Russell Lang
        pointed this out). This should avoid problems with files
        that redefine standards PostScript operators with totally
        different semantics, e.g. lt (less than) to mean lineto.
        If you notice different results than before use the -nb
        option to switch back to the previous style (-dNOBIND)
        and send an example to the author, please.</li>
    <li>changed the version of drvbase due to a new virtual
        function. This means that all plugins need to be updated
        (just the .dll not the keys).</li>
    <li>added a check for a failure in the constructor of drvWMF.</li>
    <li>fixed a compilation problem for systems that don't
        support shared libraries and some warnings issued by the
        IRIX C++ compiler.</li>
    <li>added the PIC backend contributed by Egil Kvaleberg (<a
        href="mailto:egil@kvaleberg.no">egil@kvaleberg.no</a>)</li>
    <li>added the backend for the <a
        href="http://www.koffice.org/kontour">Kontour</a> format
        - contributed by Kai-Uwe Sattler <a
        href="mailto:(kus@iti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de">(kus@iti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de</a>)</li>
    <li>added some files missing for the compilation under
        Windows and adapted the makefile.</li>
    <li>changed the way the gsview32.ini file is searched.</li>
    <li>pstoedit now also uses the GS_LIB path from the gsview32.ini
        file ( GhostscriptInclude entry). This was done because
        in some situations the gswin32.dll could not find its own
        init files.</li>
    <li>activated the (dead) -s option again which allows to
        specify a scaling factor for the output. At the moment it
        is just active for the idraw backend.</li>
    <li>added a MetaPost backend provided by <a
        href="mailto:pakin@cs.uiuc.edu">Scott Pakin</a>.</li>
    <li>changed the source code to be compilable against the ANSI
        iostream header files. This was needed because the
        metapost backend uses STL and the standard string class
        and thus the ANSI headers are needed.</li>
    <li>In this version the drvbase class was changed. This means
        that you need to get a new version of the plugin.dll if
        you have a previous version. Otherwise you will get an
        error message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.03:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>better handling of &quot;extreme&quot; dash patterns. If
        the ratio on/off is &gt; 100 then the line is treated as
        solid now.</li>
    <li>source code available now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.02:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>new driver for the AI (Adobe Illustrator) format. This is
        not a real native pstoedit driver but instead just a
        conversion to the AI format using the ps2ai.ps that comes
        with every installation of GhostScript. It is included to
        provide the same &quot;look-and-feel&quot; for the
        conversion to AI. The additional benefit is that this
        conversion is now available also via the &quot;convert-to-vector&quot;
        menu of Gsview. However, lot's of files don't convert
        nicely or at all using ps2ai.ps. So a native pstoedit
        driver would be much better. Anyone out there to take
        this ? The AI format is usable for example by Mayura Draw
        (<a href="http://www.mayura.com">http://www.mayura.com</a>
        ). Also a driver to the Mayura native format would be
        nice. <br>
        However, this new driver relies on a slightly modified ps2ai.ps
        which hopefully will go into the next version of
        GhostScript.</li>
    <li>Added the handling of GhostScript output in the case the
        pstoedit.dll is used by gsview. Now also messages from
        GhostScript can be seen in the Gsview message box.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.01:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Added a work-around for files redefining &quot;length&quot;</li>
    <li>extended the trouble-shooting section in the manual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.00:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Eliminated compatibility problem with GhostScript 5.xx </li>
    <li>packed most stuff into a pstoedit.dll under windows. This
        dll can now be called&nbsp; by gsview. pstoedit.exe is
        just a small program calling the pstoedit.dll</li>
    <li>additional drivers can now be put into separate plugin-libraries.
        See <a href="pstoedit.3.00.manual.html">the manual </a>for
        availability of such drivers.</li>
    <li>pstoedit now calls GhostScript via the DLL interface
        under Windows. Thanks to Russell Lang for his help
        regarding this.</li>
    <li>new HPGL driver contributed by Peter Katzmann (<a
        href="mailto:p.katzmann@thiesen.com">p.katzmann@thiesen.com</a>)</li>
    <li>fix of a bug in pstoedit.ph which caused an infinite loop.</li>
    <li>some changes in pstoedit.ph to cope with changes in newer
        version of ghostscript.</li>
    <li>fix of s small bug in drvidraw by Jorge A. Gautier (<a
        href="mailto:jgautier@netcom.com">jgautier@netcom.com</a>)</li>
    <li>include a new Java GUI contributed by Leszek Piotrowicz (<a
        href="mailto:leszek@sopot.rodan.pl">leszek@sopot.rodan.pl</a>)</li>
    <li>new backend for Tcl/Tk contributed by Chris Cox&nbsp; (<a
        href="mailto:ccox@airmail.net">ccox@airmail.net</a>)</li>
    <li>new internal architecture which now allows link time and
        run-time loading of backends.</li>
    <li>temporarily dropped support for the OS/2 MET backend (the
        author was not able to adapt the backend to the new
        architecture so far), </li>
    <li>rewrite of the WMF backend by Thorsten Behrens&nbsp; (<a
        href="mailto:Thorsten_Behrens@public.uni-hamburg.de">Thorsten_Behrens@public.uni-hamburg.de</a>)
        and Bjoern Petersen. The first version of this driver
        relied on Borland 5.0 and thus was not portable to other
        compilers. Now it uses the pure Windows API and thus
        compiles also with Visual C++</li>
    <li>added a new &quot;gs&quot; pseudo backend which runs
        GhostScript with a given GhostScript output device, e.g.
        -f gs:pdfwrite runs the GhostScript PDF writer.</li>
    <li>added a -v (for verbose) option</li>
    <li>added a -split option to split the output into individual
        files for each page</li>
    <li>Bug fix: a default font specified using -df was not used
        in the xfig backend</li>
    <li>workarounds for two bugs on djgpp (binary open and
        tempnam)</li>
    <li>-f ps supports emission of curvetos (proposal and partial
        patch from <br>
        Erik Lundh (<a href="mailto:Erik.Lundh@compelcon.se">Erik.Lundh@compelcon.se</a>))</li>
    <li>PostScript output now generates some DSC comments. At
        least GhostView understands the output.</li>
    <li>xfig output is compatible with new format of xfig 3.2</li>
    <li>xfig output now creates x-splines</li>
    <li>image support for xfig done by Leszek Piotrowicz&nbsp; (<a
        href="mailto:leszek@sopot.rodan.pl">leszek@sopot.rodan.pl</a>)
    </li>
    <li>image support for Framemaker-MIF format</li>
    <li>added support for dashes for Framemaker-MIF format</li>
    <li>fixed a problem with detection of not available files (MSVC
        only)</li>
    <li>Changed some code in drvbase.h in order to work around a
        not implemented feature of the HP-CC compiler.</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem that causes Turbo C++ to hang (compiler
        problem)</li>
    <li>changed usage of deviceinfo to currentpagedevice for
        better compatibility with newer version of GhostScript (thanks
        to Peter L. Deutsch for the hint).</li>
    <li>fixed a bug caused by explicit HWResolution settings from
        with .ps file (font sizes were wrong)<br>
        </li>
