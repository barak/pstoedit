<h2>Changelog for pstoedit:</h2>

<h2>New or changed in 3.15:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>fixed a compilation problem and makefile problem (make install).</li>
  <li>switch to a new documentation style. The manual page is now originally written in LaTeX
    and translated to Un*x man format and HTML. Thanks to Rolf Niepraschk (<a
    href="mailto:niepraschk@ptb.de">niepraschk@ptb.de</a>)&nbsp; for this work. The Linux
    community will have big thanks for this contribution.</li>
  <li>added a new option to set the page size for the output medium. However this is currently
    used by the libplot backend only.</li>
  <li>some small correction on the libplot driver.</li>
  <li>fixed the broken -scale option for the tgif backend.</li>
  <li>backends can now access the current setting of the miterlimit using currentMiterLimit().</li>
  <li>text consisting entirely of spaces is now suppressed. This caused problems with some
    backends, e.g. xfig.</li>
  <li>changed the version of drvbase (because of the miterlimit and pagesize support). This
    means that all plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will
    get an error message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.14:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>added two checkboxes for the importps dialog</li>
  <li>bug fix related to font caching in the EMF backend</li>
  <li>added a bugfix for the MetaPost backend received from Scott Pakin</li>
  <li>incorporated a lot of improvements to the libplot driver. Thanks to Robert S. Maier <a
    href="mailto:rsm@math.arizona.edu">rsm@math.arizona.edu</a><br>
    Notice: most of these improvement will need at least libplot version 2.3. See drvlplot.cpp
    for all the new options.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now implicitly looks for a driver specific fontmap file named
    &lt;drivername&gt;.fmp </li>
  <li>fixed a problem (bug in gs??) which was caused by some PDF files when gs5.50 was used.
    This problem did not occur anymore with newer versions of gs.</li>
  <li>added the classed needed by the generated Java Code to the distribution (see java
    subdirectory)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.13:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>change in frontend and drvbase: Now the full effective font matrix can be retrieved by
    backends</li>
  <li>changed again the version of drvbase (because of the font matrix functions). This means
    that all plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will get
    an error message.</li>
  <li>added a new backend for the sketch format ( <a href="http://www.online.de/home/sketch/">http://www.online.de/home/sketch/</a>
    ) contributed by <br>
    Bernhard Herzog &lt; <a href="mailto:herzog@online.de">herzog@online.de</a>&nbsp; &gt;</li>
  <li>many improvements in the MetaPost backend and a better fontmap.mpost by Scott Pakin.</li>
  <li>minor bug fix with line width and text elements in the TGIF backend.</li>
  <li>added an option to the TGIF backend to generate HREF attributes for each text element
    (proposed by Tobias Buchal <a href="mailto:buchal41@che41a0.der.edf.fr">buchal41@che41a0.der.edf.fr</a>).
    This is still in an experimenal stage!</li>
  <li>added an option (-nc) to force the replacement of curves with line segments even for
    backends that support curves.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug with the -flat option not beeing honoured correctly in combination with the
    new -nc option</li>
  <li>added an option to emulate clipping (-sclip). This however results in larger number of
    points ! Use it only if the missing support for clipping causes problems with your file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.12:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>small bug fix in the meta post backend (blank font names) and in the fontmap.mpost file.</li>
  <li>several bug fixes and code reorganization in the subpath simulation part.</li>
  <li>sub path simulation is now available for all backends, not just xfig. However, this was
    not tested very intensively so far. It works quite well with xfig and tgif.</li>
  <li>bug fix for related to the usage of &quot;-f gs:...&quot;.</li>
  <li>small bug fix in the metapost driver and some additions to the fontmap.mpost file.</li>
  <li>added a setglobal also for the &quot;non -nb&quot; case to pstoedit.pro to cope with
    gs5.82.</li>
  <li>bux fix in documentation (-fontmap instead of -mapfile).</li>
  <li>added some support for easier retrieval of dash patterns from within backends.</li>
  <li>extended the check for &quot;mergable&quot; path to include also eofilled pathes and
    made pathsCanBeMerged virtual so it can be overloaded by a specific backend.</li>
  <li>changed again the version of drvbase. This means that all plugins need to be updated
    (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will get an error message.</li>
  <li>bug fix in the EMF driver of the plugins.dll and importps.dll regarding the handling of
    closepath.</li>
  <li>added an option to the xfig backend to set the paper width (-f &quot;xfig:-depth <em>depth
    in inches</em>&quot;)</li>
  <li>added an option to the ps2ai driver (-88) to activate the AI-88 format instead of the
    AI-3 format</li>
  <li>added a fontmap.win in the misc directory as an example for a Windows fontmap file.
    (-fontmap option)</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.11:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>improved handling of TrueType fonts under Windows 9x/NT. Pstoedit can now deal with
    TrueType fonts if GhostScript is configured for TrueType support.</li>
  <li>fixed an incompatibility with older version of GhostScript</li>
  <li>fixed a bug that was caused when the GS_LIB variable was set.</li>
  <li>added a new backend for the libplot (GNU plotutils) library () (GNU MetaFiles). This
    allows to use the additional format drivers of the GNU plotting utilities.</li>
  <li>Burkhard Plaum <a href="mailto:(plaum@IPF.Uni-Stuttgart.de">(plaum@IPF.Uni-Stuttgart.de</a>)
    added support for complex filled paths (paths consisting of an arbitraty sequence of
    moveto, lineto and curveto in combination with fill and eofill) to the xfig backend. In
    future, this will be made available to other backend that don't support such pathes as
    well. In order to activate this feature you need to specify the -ssp (simulate sub paths)
    option.</li>
  <li>changed again the version of drvbase due to the support for complex paths. This means
    that all plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys). Otherwise you will get
    an error message.</li>
  <li>improved the EMF driver in the importps.dll. I now generates much more compact EMF
    files.</li>
  <li>Added a general option for specifying a file containing a font mapping (document font
    -&gt; font in target format). So far this was just used in the mpost backend but this is
    now available for general usage. See the misc directory in the source distribution for an
    example.</li>
  <li>removed the STL dependency in the mport driver. This driver can now be compiled as well
    without having the STL.</li>
  <li>some internal code reorganization.</li>
  <li>fixed a bug in the test target of the makefile</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.10:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>replaced the -dNOBIND with -dDELAYBIND (Russell Lang pointed this out). This should
    avoid problems with files that redefine standards PostScript operators with totally
    different semantics, e.g. lt (less than) to mean lineto. If you notice different results
    than before use the -nb option to switch back to the previous style (-dNOBIND) and send an
    example to the author, please.</li>
  <li>changed the version of drvbase due to a new virtual function. This means that all
    plugins need to be updated (just the .dll not the keys).</li>
  <li>added a check for a failure in the constructor of drvWMF.</li>
  <li>fixed a compilation problem for systems that don't support shared libraries and some
    warnings issued by the IRIX C++ compiler.</li>
  <li>added the PIC backend contributed by Egil Kvaleberg (<a href="mailto:egil@kvaleberg.no">egil@kvaleberg.no</a>)</li>
  <li>added the backend for the <a
    href="http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~sattler/killustrator.html">Killustrator</a>
    format - contributed by Kai-Uwe Sattler&nbsp; <a
    href="mailto:(kus@iti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de">(kus@iti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de</a>)</li>
  <li>added some files missing for the compilation under Windows and adapted the makefile.</li>
  <li>changed the way the gsview32.ini file is searched.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now also uses the GS_LIB path from the gsview32.ini file ( GhostscriptInclude
    entry). This was done because in some situations the gswin32.dll could not find its own
    init files.</li>
  <li>activated the (dead) -s option again which allows to specify a scaling factor for the
    output. At the moment it is just active for the idraw backend.</li>
  <li>added a MetaPost backend provided by <a href="mailto:pakin@cs.uiuc.edu">Scott Pakin</a>.</li>
  <li>changed the source code to be compilable against the ANSI iostream header files. This
    was needed because the metapost backend uses STL and the standard string class and thus
    the ANSI headers are needed.</li>
  <li>In this version the drvbase class was changed. This means that you need to get a new
    version of the plugin.dll if you have a previous version. Otherwise you will get an error
    message.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.03:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>better handling of &quot;extreme&quot; dash patterns. If the ratio on/off is &gt; 100
    then the line is treated as solid now.</li>
  <li>source code available now.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.02:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>new driver for the AI (Adobe Illustrator) format. This is not a real native pstoedit
    driver but instead just a conversion to the AI format using the ps2ai.ps that comes with
    every installation of GhostScript. It is included to provide the same
    &quot;look-and-feel&quot; for the conversion to AI. The additional benefit is that this
    conversion is now available also via the &quot;convert-to-vector&quot; menu of Gsview.
    However, lot's of files don't convert nicely or at all using ps2ai.ps. So a native
    pstoedit driver would be much better. Anyone out there to take this ? The AI format is
    usable for example by Mayura Draw (<a href="http://www.mayura.com">http://www.mayura.com</a>
    ). Also a driver to the Mayura native format would be nice. <br>
    However, this new driver relies on a slightly modified ps2ai.ps which hopefully will go
    into the next version of GhostScript.</li>
  <li>Added the handling of GhostScript output in the case the pstoedit.dll is used by gsview.
    Now also messages from GhostScript can be seen in the Gsview message box.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.01:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Added a work-around for files redefining &quot;length&quot;</li>
  <li>extended the trouble-shooting section in the manual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New or changed in 3.00:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminated compatibility problem with GhostScript 5.xx </li>
  <li>packed most stuff into a pstoedit.dll under windows. This dll can now be called&nbsp; by
    gsview. pstoedit.exe is just a small program calling the pstoedit.dll</li>
  <li>additional drivers can now be put into separate plugin-libraries. See <a
    HREF="pstoedit.3.00.manual.html">the manual </a>for availability of such drivers.</li>
  <li>pstoedit now calls GhostScript via the DLL interface under Windows. Thanks to Russell
    Lang for his help regarding this.</li>
  <li>new HPGL driver contributed by Peter Katzmann <a href="mailto:p.katzmann@thiesen.com">p.katzmann@thiesen.com
    </a></li>
  <li>fix of a bug in pstoedit.ph which caused an infinite loop.</li>
  <li>some changes in pstoedit.ph to cope with changes in newer version of ghostscript.</li>
  <li>fix of s small bug in drvidraw by Jorge A. Gautier <a href="mailto:jgautier@netcom.com">jgautier@netcom.com</a>
  </li>
  <li>include a new Java GUI contributed by Leszek Piotrowicz <a
    href="mailto:leszek@sopot.rodan.pl">leszek@sopot.rodan.pl</a></li>
  <li>new backend for Tcl/Tk contributed by Chris Cox&nbsp; <a href="mailto:ccox@airmail.net">ccox@airmail.net</a>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li>new internal architecture which now allows link time and run-time loading of backends.</li>
  <li>temporarily dropped support for the OS/2 MET backend (the author was not able to adapt
    the backend to the new architecture so far), </li>
  <li>rewrite of the WMF backend by Thorsten Behrens&nbsp; <a
    href="mailto:Thorsten_Behrens@public.uni-hamburg.de">Thorsten_Behrens@public.uni-hamburg.de</a>
    &nbsp; and Bjoern Petersen. The first version of this driver relied on Borland 5.0 and
    thus was not portable to other compilers. Now it uses the pure Windows API and thus
    compiles also with Visual C++</li>
  <li>added a new &quot;gs&quot; pseudo backend which runs GhostScript with a given
    GhostScript output device, e.g. -f gs:pdfwrite runs the GhostScript PDF writer.</li>
  <li>added a -v (for verbose) option</li>
  <li>added a -split option to split the output into individual files for each page</li>
  <li>Bug fix: a default font specified using -df was not used in the xfig backend</li>
  <li>workarounds for two bugs on djgpp (binary open and tempnam)</li>
  <li>-f ps supports emission of curvetos (proposal and partial patch from <br>
    Erik Lundh <a href="mailto:Erik.Lundh@compelcon.se">Erik.Lundh@compelcon.se</a>)</li>
  <li>PostScript output now generates some DSC comments. At least GhostView understands the
    output.</li>
  <li>xfig output is compatible with new format of xfig 3.2</li>
  <li>xfig output now creates x-splines</li>
  <li>image support for xfig done by Leszek Piotrowicz&nbsp; <a
    href="mailto:leszek@sopot.rodan.pl">leszek@sopot.rodan.pl</a> </li>
  <li>image support for Framemaker-MIF format</li>
  <li>added support for dashes for Framemaker-MIF format</li>
  <li>fixed a problem with detection of not available files (MSVC only)</li>
  <li>Changed some code in drvbase.h in order to work around a not implemented feature of the
    HP-CC compiler.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem that causes Turbo C++ to hang (compiler problem)</li>
  <li>changed usage of deviceinfo to currentpagedevice for better compatibility with newer
    version of GhostScript (thanks to Peter L. Deutsch for the hint).</li>
  <li>fixed a bug caused by explicit HWResolution settings from with .ps file (font sizes were
    wrong)<br>
  </li>
