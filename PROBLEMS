* ( ) in text are not handled correctly when producing flat PostScript
  output. 
* Pure text documents should better be translated into text flow instead
  of a mess of text objects (as does pstohtml).
* Non standard fonts (e.g. TeX's bitmap fonts ) are translated into Courier.
* No support for special character encodings.
* No support for bitmap images
* Framemaker addes linewidth also to linelength. So if the linewidth is not very
  small relative to the linelength the generated line will look very different 
  from the original one.

  This we want:
     -----------
     |         |
     *   *     *
     |         |
     -----------

  This we get:
  -----------------
  |               |
  |  *   *     *  |
  |               |
  -----------------
  This could be corrected by readjusting the points (substract/add line width)
